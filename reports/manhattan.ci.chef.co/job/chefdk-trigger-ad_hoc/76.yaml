In general, you should not be using this method in your software definitions as it is an internal implementation detail of the NetFetcher. If you disagree with this statement, you should open an issue on the Omnibus repository on GitHub an explain your use case. For now, I will return the path to the downloaded file on disk, but please rethink the problem you are trying to solve :).

              Error:

                  Application 'chef-dk' contains gems in the lockfile which are
              not accessible by rubygems. This usually occurs when you fetch gems from git in
              your Gemfile and do not install the same version of the gems beforehand.

              The Gemfile.lock is located here:
              - C:/omnibus-ruby/src/chefdk/chef-dk/Gemfile.lock

              The offending gems are:
              - chef (12.8.1) from git://github.com/chef/chef.git (at 12.8.1@b5860b4)

              Rubygems is configured to search the following paths:
              - C:/jenkins/.gem/ruby/2.1.0
              - C:/opscode/chefdk/embedded/lib/ruby/gems/2.1.0

              If these seem wrong, you might need to set GEM_HOME or other environment
              variables before running appbundler
