In general, you should not be using this method in your software definitions as it is an internal implementation detail of the NetFetcher.

For now, I will return the path to the downloaded file on disk, but please rethink the problem you are trying to solve :).

In general, you should not be using this method in your software definitions as it is an internal implementation detail of the NetFetcher. If you disagree with this statement, you should open an issue on the Omnibus repository on GitHub an explain your use case. For now, I will return the path to the downloaded file on disk, but please rethink the problem you are trying to solve :).

In general, you should not be using this method in your software definitions as it is an internal implementation detail of the NetFetcher. If you disagree with this statement, you should open an issue on the Omnibus repository on GitHub an explain your use case. For now, I will return the path to the downloaded file on disk, but please rethink the problem you are trying to solve :).
