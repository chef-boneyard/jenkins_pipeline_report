Versions that contain a dash and should be considered an earlier version (e.g. pre-releases) may actually be ordered as later (e.g. 12.0.0-rc.6 > 12.0.0). We'll work around this by replacing dashes (-) with tildes (~). Converting `2.0.0-alpha.4+20160415161232.git.5.140ca19' to `2.0.0~alpha.4+20160415161232.git.5.140ca19'.
